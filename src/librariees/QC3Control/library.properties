sentence=Sets the voltage of a Quick Charge 3.0 source.
paragraph=Makes it possible to for Arduino to control the output voltage of a Quick Charge 3.0 mains charger or powerbank to 5V, 9V, 12V (or 20V  if using a class B power source), or any voltage between 3.6V and 12V (20V) by 200mV steps. The source needs to support the Quick Charge 3.0 technology of Qualcomm. This project is based on QC2Control by Timo Engelgeer (Septillion) <github@septillion.nl>
